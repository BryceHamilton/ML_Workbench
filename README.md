### COMP 472 A1: Project Instructions
- MLbench.py.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook that contains the required experiments
- Running the notebook will automatically generate the output reports, visuals, graphs, and metrics required
    - model predictions in the specified format are written to the `output` folder in the `Assignment 1` directory
- The notebook contains markdown explaining:
    - what each section of cells is for
    - the linear sequence of experiment execution
